      Common Signs of Illness in Dogs.

      Symptoms of a sick dog can vary widely depending on the underlying cause, age, and breed. Key indicators include.

      <b>Changes in Appetite or Thirst: </b>A sudden refusal to eat or a significant increase in water consumption can signal various health problems.

      <b>Lethargy and Weakness:</b> Noticeable decrease in energy levels, 
      reluctance to play or go for walks, and excessive sleeping.

      <b>Vomiting or Diarrhea:</b> Frequent digestive issues can lead to dehydration
       and may indicate a range of illnesses, from dietary indiscretion to infections or organ issues.

     <b>Difficulty Breathing:</b> Coughing, wheezing, rapid breathing,
       or shortness of breath are emergencies.

      <b>Changes in Urination: </b>Increased frequency, straining, blood in the urine,
       or an inability to urinate can indicate urinary tract infections or kidney issues.

      <b>Physical Symptoms:</b> Limping, swelling, unusual lumps, red eyes, discharge from the eyes or nose, or a dull coat.

      <b>Behavioral Changes: </b>Increased irritability, hiding, whining, or sensitivity to touch might indicate pain or discomfort.
