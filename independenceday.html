                Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public holiday in India commemorating the nation's independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947. On this day the Indian Independence Act 1947 came into effect, transferring legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly. India attained independence following the independence movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience led by Indian National Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.[1]

Independence coincided with the partition of India
,[2] in which British India was divided into the Dominions of India 
and Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mas
s casualties. On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, 
Jawaharlal Nehru raised the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi.
 On each subsequent Independence Day, the incumbent Prime Minister customarily raises the flag
  and gives an address to the nation.[3] The entire event is broadcast by Doordarshan,
   India's national broadcaster, and usually begins with the shehnai music of Ustad Bismillah Khan.
    Independence Day is observed throughout India with flag-hoisting ceremonies,
     parades and cultural events. It is a national holiday in the country.[4][5][6]
